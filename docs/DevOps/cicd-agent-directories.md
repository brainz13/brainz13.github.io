# Build Agent Directories 

The Microsoft DevOps Agent uses some directories to work and build in. The on premise build agent uses them as well as the cloud container agent.

There are:

| directory | variable | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| s | Build.Repository.LocalPath | "sources" - checked out sources and build folder, like your local project folder |
| b | Build.BinariesDirectory | "binaries" - built binaries |
| a | Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory | "artifacts" - staging folder to collect artifacts to be published |

Check the [predefined variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) for referencing directories and variables in your pipelines.
